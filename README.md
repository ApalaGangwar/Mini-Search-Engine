# Mini-Search-Engine
It is a console based CPP project.
Firstly an authentication menu will be displayed. Where user will register and then login to move to next menu.
In the next menu user has a choice to create document, append to document, search a word in the documents, displaying documents, update password, delete account and logout.
Multiple users can register and login but searching will only be done in the documents associated with that user.
Password of the user is masked using XOR encoding.
The project follows standardization to maintain code quality. All the .h files are in include folder. CPP files are in src folder.
Compilation string in is doc folder and main.cpp in tests folder.
To upgrade the project one can try to run it using makefile and add validation in password. The future scope can be extended by searching the string rather than single word.
VS Code is the environment used.
